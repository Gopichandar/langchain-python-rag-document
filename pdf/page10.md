“In the world of finance, data analysis is the most important function of an analyst. One of the most challenging tasks is to assimilate good quality and reliable data on a consistent basis. Due to the lack of options, analysts are forced to gather data from various different sources which waste valuable time and effort. I-darts Market Analytics platform enables analysts to access data with utmost ease, which improves efficiency and facilitates better analysis. Even though it is loaded with a vast amount of data, the user experience has not been compromised. The simplicity of the platform is amazing keeping in mind the complexity of the data presented to the user.

Overall, this product saves time, enables greater productivity and delivers the best user experience”.

At Congruent, we are obsessively passionate about solving the US retirement industry’s technology challenges using our CORE suite of enterprise solutions. As we embarked on upgrading the UI/UX of our platform to be ready for tomorrow, we evaluated several software companies to work with our UI design team and found iDarts to be the prefect foil for us. iDarts understood the needs of the demanding US market that we were articulating and works with our team as their extension rather than a vendor at an arms length !!

A great product and excellent support service is what distinguishes i-darts from its competitors. One stop shop for all needs of Market data, scanners, Charting Tools and Analytics makes Market Tracker (powered by i-darts) the most in-depth product available in the market. While there are various other software/data vendors in the market place, each one specializes only on one aspect leaving the other areas deficient. Market Tracker on the other hand has adopted a holistic approach to Market Analysis. It is as valuable for a trader as to an investor. Further, their quest for improvement leaves you spell bound with the management more than willing to solicit feedback and incorporate requirements to enhance user experience. A rare phenomenon in my experience of more than a decade in financial markets!

Nanda Krishnan  
`Bangalore`

“I have been watching I-darts provided Market tracker past 4 years.

I found the following features are very good.

Quote gives all information about the company (script) 52w high, low and all time high and low. Moving average ?those can trade with watching MA it is helpful without entering in to charts. While talking to client PE, EPS, Market cap and YTD very helpful all in one shot.

Flash data, FII activity data, Announcement, Board meetings

While trading: – Heat map, Market Dynamic, Market Breadth help me to get market trend.

Trade before:- Resistance and supports are accurate in market tracker. S2 S1 P R1 R2 are fantastic especially in nifty. I can say its 90% accurate. So many times i trade with R&S accurately.

Live scanner :- it gives good information for short and midterm traders like you can choose 3-6-12 months low stocks and high stocks. I suggest buy 3-6 -12 months low stocks especially nifty 50 stocks 100% get profits. Once i bought SIEMENS 3 months low and 6 months low got doubled the profit in long term with 1 year 2012.

FNO corner: – Put/ call ratio Laggards is fantastic who can trade for strategic and intraday and bullish traders. Take 19-05-2014 PCR laggards especially UNITECH Puts 632 and calls 3081 trades what does it means? It means calls are buying if u see entire day the ratio has increased huge. Based on PCR laggards traded intraday and delivery. Mc dowel in June PCR laggards and Arbitrate has given blindly profit of rs. 250. Like so many examples are with me. Most bullish futures : it gives bullish futures and arbitrage opportunity ex: June and July HDFC bank has a huge spread. In the june month spread 19 and july spread 10. I did this arbitrage. FNO corner gives open interest information based on this I find out OI losers and gainers.

Buy & sell signals: are good if we kept 10-15 min time it gives good trend can say 80% if trades with stoploss  
Charts : are good, Trade with RSI defiantly get profits 90%. MACD also good indicator on 14-july RSI and macd has given a clear indication to buy nifty. Volume indicators are given the buy opportunity on day.

Finally : market tracker is very much useful for brokers and traders”
